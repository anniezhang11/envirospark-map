## File Overview

The code makes use of two relevant APIs: the [Google Maps JS API ](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript) for the bulk of the frontend and the [Travel Time API](https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/introduction) for drive radius data. 

Relevant code can be found entirely in `src/App.js`. The `data` folder contains a sample POST request to the Travel Time API as well as some response data separated into 6 JSON files.
